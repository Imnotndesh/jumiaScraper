# HONEY (The Kenyan version)

This is a tool to fetch data from multiple kenyan marketplaces related to your search and finds you the best deals from each 
marketplace.

The tool is fully written in python and conveys athered info in two ways:
    1. Through a JSON file ("In the works")
    2. Directly on the terminal
    (i am also workin on making it into an api)

# HOW DO I GET IT WORKING
 1. Cjeck if you have an Python Interprator Installed.
    Ensure you have an install of python in your system, if not you can fetch the install instructions from python.org

 2. Install Beautiful Soup.
    This can be done from your terminal using the command:
            On windows : $ pip install Beautifulsoup4 
            On linux : $ pip3 install Beautifulsoup4

 3. Install requests.
    This can be done from your terminal using the command:
            On windows : $ pip install requests 
            On linux : $ pip3 install requests

 4. Run the script by double clicking the .py file

 5. Once running enter the category or product you want and the program will fetch the data for you from multiple sites.

 The program will display the fetched data to you including links to the product or if you chose the data to be displayed via JSON the file will be saved in the same directory as where the scraper file is located.

 Hope you enjoy the program and more features coming soon as i add more sites.

 Thanks.
